# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts the presence of heart disease using clinical data from the UCI dataset. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, logistic regression model training, and performance evaluation with accuracy and recall metrics.
# 🏥 Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical parameters. It leverages the UCI Heart Disease dataset and includes data analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📁 Dataset
- Dataset used: `heart.csv` from the UCI repository
- Features include: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
- Target: `0` (no heart disease) or `1` (presence of heart disease)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Count plots by target and gender
- Pair plots to observe feature relationships
- Statistical summaries to understand data distribution

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 Model
- Algorithm used: **Logistic Regression**
- Accuracy evaluated using:
  - Accuracy score
  - Recall
  - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
